### DESIGN PRINCIPLES.
- Determine dynamic parts of application(class) and separate it from constant parts.
- Programm on interface level and not on implementation level.
- Choose composition where it possible and not inheritance 
  Composition means that child class have instances of behaviours classes in it members. 
  Behaviour is not inherited but provided by correct picking of an object in the class member.
- Aim to low coupling of interacted objects.

All of this helps to build low coupled code and reuse existing code many times. 
It reduces time for development when system is growing and requiring more and more maintainance.
